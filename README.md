# IntroDeepLearning

Introduction to Deep Learning using Pytorch with Spyder/Jupyter Notebooks for 
Facebook-Udacity Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge Program #1

Use PyTorch for building deep learning models. 

1. Intro to PyTorch with Tensors (main data structure of Pytorch)
2. Perform simple operations to Tensors - multi-dimensional arrays
3. Use PyTorch to build network and run data forward through it
4. Define a loss and optimization method to train neural network on dataset of handwritten digits
5.Test network is able to generalize through validation
6. Use pre-trained networks to improve performance of classifier (transfer learning)
